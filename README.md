Basic practice python programs

#### Overview:
I am in no way a professional programmer, especially in python. This directory serves as a storage medium for practice programs I can find to enhance my knowledge and abilities with this language. They will most likely be very basic and will have little to no practical application. However, please feel free to let me know of any program ideas you may have.
